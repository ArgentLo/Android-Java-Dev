# Android Development Basic

Personal Project on Android Application Development. 

The main materials are from the [Udacity **Advanced Android Java** Online Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) provide by **Google**.

This repository consists of several applications I built along the way of learning Android. 


### Setup development environment

* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/sdk/index.html)

* [Android SDK Tools](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/sdk/index.html)

* [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/ndk/downloads/index.html)

### Build & Run the application

* Get the source code.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ArgentLo/Android-Dev-Basic.git
```

* Install in your system with the Android NDK 14+ and Android NDK 16+.

* Use Android Studio to further config the apps.

* Kick off the apps by running a VM **Emulator** or running on your Android phone.

### Notice

* Some application resources collected from the internet, including "drawable", code snippets, etc.
* Most applications require **internet connection**.
